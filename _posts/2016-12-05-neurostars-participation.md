# NeuroStars as a platform for involvement

A key component to NeuroStorm is community involvement and engagement. We wish to work with neuroscientists, engineers, and data scientists, to maximize the interoperability of tools and encourage common priorities in research (such as, reproducibility, extensiblity).

As such, we have created the `#neurostorm` tag on [neurostars.org](http://neurostars.org). We encourage users to ask questions, post suggestions, and generally get involved via this tag and will be monitoring it to ensure that everyone is being heard.

Check out our [first neurostarts post](https://neurostars.org/t/neurostorm-proposing-a-global-platform-for-neuroscience/40) for more info!
