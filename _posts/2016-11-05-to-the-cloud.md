# Introducing NeuroStorm

A recent [Neuron Neuroview](http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)30783-8) (open-access link [here](https://github.com/jovo/cv/raw/master/ToTheCloud.pdf)) highlighted a new initiative to develop a platform for globalized neuroscience. This initiative aims to build a unified computational ecosystem to accelerate global neuroscience discovery, in particular, via easing the process linking data to models to experiments.

> As the next generation of brain scientists grows up, we have an opportunity to provide them with a canvas on which they can craft ever more creative portraits of our minds.

This initiative was spawned from a series of workshops. In the first, Global Brain Hack 2016 hosted at Johns Hopkins University, participants worked together to highlight the three “Grand Challenges” of modern brain science, and suggest ways in which community members can get involved (available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06548)).

Our next steps include laying the groundwork for a centralized open-access cloud data storage platform for neuroimaging data. We will then work with labs and organizations across North America and the World to ingest all known publicly available image datasets, ranging in scale from electron microscopy to MRI. With this powerful and accessible platform at our disposal, we will then work on educating the community with workshops about integrating their tools and workflows with this database. As the community of users grows, we will expand our development team and thereby capability to support more types of data and provide standardized computing solutions for researchers, as well.

The best way to get involved is to send us an email at [support@neurodata.io](mailto:support@neurodata.io), and subscribe to stay up to date with posts about news, tutorials, and other information. 

We're excited to share our upcoming journey with you - it's bound to be en-lightning (sorry, had to).
